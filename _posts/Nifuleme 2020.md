#### About The Project

"New Year" has always been a grand ceremony in the Chinese cultural circle. Along with this profound event, three basic New Year cultural image carriers have solidified into the consciousness of each of us in the long history, namely: red envelopes, spring couplets and blessing stickers. The red envelope is used as the medium; the spring couplets are written in double vertical lines to correspond to the architectural culture of the double-door house; and the simple rhombus and upside-down form of the stickers with the word "Fu" all convey special Chinese cultural characteristics.

Ziroom Design Center has chosen "Fu" stickers as a creative carrier to design blessings in 2020. In addition to the possibility of traditional offline printing carriers, we are also trying to adopt a more technologically interconnected form: in the form of a website, more designers can participate in the creation of "Fu stickers". We try to continue to collect 2020 design blessings and piece them together into a larger diamond-shaped expression. Across the world, we offer 2020 design blessings for 2020.

# Platform

## Upload and display

We designed and developed a platform for uploading and displaying works for this event, and demonstrated the atmosphere of the event through a dynamic interpretation of "Fu" stickers.
