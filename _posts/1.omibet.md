#### About The Project
Omibet.io is a blockchain-powered and distributed Global Gaming platform that uses smart contracts and blockchain to provide a truly fair gaming environment. Until recently, it was very expensive for game developers to deploy successful apps in the online gambling market, so the market is dominated by large incumbents with very high margins (in excess of 10%). The operator's role is to control the fairness of the gambling process, which can lead to a variety of issues - it has been very simple for programmers to fix the random number's fairness. Extensive Licensing and Regulatory arrangements were previously implemented to aid in Player trust issues; however, with omibet.io technology, these are no longer required.

Joined the omibet team in June 2022, where I am responsible for the inception and development management of products. This includes the creation of brand identity, design systems, responsive versions of pages and components, as well as delivering high-fidelity prototypes to developers.

#### Update
09.2023 - 02.2024 As a design engineer, responsible for design optimization and front-end implementation.

Stack: React, Next.JS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.

# Branding

## Friendly brand graphics and mascot bring it closer to users and earn respect in a fierce marketplace.
Omibet strives to be a popular crypto gaming platform for its users, and has developed a brand graphic and mascot centered on the mascot "Omi". My goal was to make it an impressive branding solution that would help the product grow, and for consistency, the badges and labels were customized in the same style.

# Product Design
## Simplicity and efficiency were the goals for designing the entire product.
#### Direction and Philosophy
While maintaining ease of use, I wanted to be able to differentiate myself from other similar products and minimize the process for users to access various features.

&nbsp;

Consistency is also very important, so I customized the design system, design tokens, and used Story Book to reduce the experience gap in development and implementation, which provided a solid foundation for increasing the number of visits and daily activity.

# Marketing

## Customize the visual design of marketing advertisements in line with the brand and product tone.

Designed welcome emails for Omibet and utilized third-party automated email platforms for management and delivery.

&nbsp;

I was responsible for the design of most of the previous marketing campaigns, and it was important in the early stages of the project to use a visual design that matched the content of each specific event and to utilize as much of the visual style as possible to appeal to the natural user.
