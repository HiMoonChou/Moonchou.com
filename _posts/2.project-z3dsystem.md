#### About The Project
The 3D component system, as part of Ziroom's graphic assets, is a team production tool developed in response to the demand for higher quality and efficiency in business growth. The direction of development was determined through the study of people of interest and user profile analysis, etc., and the development of the generic components - Ziru's product and character components was carried out, which was synchronized to be compatible with the four types of renderers by normalizing the parameters, and the processing of the 3D requirements was completed quickly by the pre-rendering mode, while the 3D designers were able to carry out a richer expansion through the component library to improve the efficiency of the team's collaboration.

&nbsp;

Ziroom 3D component system has a basic sandbox worldview, which retains the high degree of product reproduction and recognition, and at the same time increases the real-life texture. The whole system consists of two parts: the general component and the character component. In the development of the general component, we complete the modeling/material/lighting setting and encapsulation through a series of design specifications; in the part of the character component, we complete the setting and standardization of the basic character image through the study of the user's portrait, combined with the image of the two-dimensional illustration, and derive the application of the component such as the expression.

# Background

## Why.How.Who.
We analyzed the project stakeholders (designers/users/business people/enterprises/brands, etc.) and the corresponding user profiles, and evaluated the important aspects of the 3D design process in terms of branding, growth, efficiency, competitiveness, and other dimensions, which helped us to clarify the design goals and the people we serve, as well as the form in which we can reach the instrumental attributes of the 3D component system.

# Pre-Render

## Efficient pre-rendering mechanism
In order to help non-3D designers to utilize 3D graphic resources, we have developed a pre-rendering mechanism, i.e., by rendering and reconstructing the elements in the scene individually, reassembling them into a completed scene and being able to be edited in graphic software; and ensuring a certain degree of mobility through the special lighting and materials in the specification, so that the graphic designers can make use of these basic product scenes to assist them in completing the design and save time while obtaining a visual style different from that of the illustration.

# System Assets

## Common Components
The general component part of the 3D component system 1.0 contains the whole series of product components of Youjia/XInshe，each product scene contains bedding/decorative objects/plants/home furnishings components corresponding to the product styles, and each component can be edited independently; in order to have a better display effect and usability expansion, we build an independent Stage for each product, so that the content in the whole product space can be fully displayed and the unity between different scenes can be guaranteed. The entire product space can be fully displayed, and ensure the unity of different scenes.
